# Introduction
## What is MK1?
MK1 is a JavaScript automation and scripting tool for iOS. It allows you to write scripts in JavaScript with an extended api that allows you to perform system actions on your device.

## Why?
MK1 is meant to allow making cool, iOS-integrated things easier. JavaScript, being both a popular language as well as an interpreted one, allows for easy development. People that are unable to create tweaks with native languages such as Objective-C can use MK1 to do things they previously couldn't.

## Where do I get it?
MK1 is currently in beta and is only available through the MK1 discord server. Join [the server](https://discord.gg/nHrEvUh) and install the most recent debian package in #announcements.
