# Actions
MK1's main feature is its extended JavaScript api that allows you to communicate with native code and perform system actions.

#### Note
Because MK1 is still in beta, all the API listed here is subject to change. Some methods may be removed, added, or modified. Don't be surprised if a beta update to MK1 breaks your scripts. Just check here to see what changed. When MK1 is out of beta, we plan to try and keep the existing API stable.
